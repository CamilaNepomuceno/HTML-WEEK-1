	<h1> About us </h1>	
		<p>C Space designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.</p>
		
		<p>C Space has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in 2010. The company made history again in 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station.</p>
		
		<p>C Space successfully achieved the historic first reflight of an orbital class rocket in 2017, and the company now regularly launches flight-proven rockets. In 2018, C Space began launching Falcon Heavy, the world’s most powerful operational rocket by a factor of two.</p>
		
		<p>As one of the world’s fastest growing providers of launch services, C Space has secured over 100 missions to its manifest, representing over $12 billion on contract. These include commercial satellite launches as well as US government missions. C Space’s Dragon spacecraft is flying numerous cargo resupply missions to the space station under a series of Commercial Resupply Services contracts. Dragon was designed from the outset to carry humans to space and will soon fly astronauts under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.</p>

	<h3>What we do? </h3>
		<p>Eventually, we started sending people to the moon by 2018. So far, Moon Express is the only private company to be granted permission (under US law) to leave Earth and land on the moon. It was given the go-ahead by the US Federal Aviation Administration in August in a move that could open up the space race to new levels.</p>
